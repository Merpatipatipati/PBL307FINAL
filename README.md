## Overview

Well Architect SIEM Implementation refers to the good design and implementation of Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), which is a system that collects, monitors, and analyzes security data from various sources within the IT infrastructure. Its primary purpose is to detect threats, respond to security incidents, and help meet audit and compliance needs. This project aims to implement a well-architected SIEM solution to enhance the security monitoring capabilities of an organization, ensuring real-time event tracking, incident response, and data integrity.

## Features

- **Network Segmentation:** Simplify management by isolating different parts of the network by ensuring that specific resources or services are only accessible to authorized users or systems.
- **Monitoring and Visualization:** Implements filtering and rate limiting to control and manage traffic during an attack.
- **Simulation:** Includes DDoS attack simulations to test and refine the system's effectiveness.
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Provides real-time insights and alerts on network security status.
